# netselect

A CLI tool as well as library to select the fastest host based on the lowest ICMP latency written in Go (golang), inspired by [apenwarr/netselect](https://github.com/apenwarr/netselect) debian package.

## Usage (CLI)

```sh
netselect [options] <host(s)>
```
### Examples
```sh
$ netselect google.com google.in google.us
google.com       55 ms  100% ok         ( 3/ 3)
google.in        56 ms  100% ok         ( 3/ 3)
google.us        59 ms  100% ok         ( 3/ 3)
```
### Learn More

Read the  [documentation](https://pgollangi.com/netselect)  for more information on the CLI tool.

## Usage (Go Library)

Here is a simple example that finds fastest hosts:

```go
hosts := []*netselect.Host{
    &netselect.Host{Address: "google.in"},
    &netselect.Host{Address: "google.com"},
}

netSelector, err :=netselect.NewNetSelector(hosts)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

fastestHosts := netSelector.Hosts // Fastest hosts in ASC order
```


## Installation 

```sh
$ go get github.com/pgollangi/netselect/cmd/netselect
$ netselect
```

### Manual

1. Download and install binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/pgollangi/netselect/releases/latest).
2. Recommended: add `netselect` executable to your $PATH.

## Building from source

`netselect` CLI is written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/), so to build the CLI yourself, you first need to have Go installed and configured on your machine.

 ### Install Go

To download and install  `Go`, please refer to the  [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). Please download  `Go 1.14.x`  or above.

### Clone this repository
